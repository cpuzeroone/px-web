Px: Mastering Vite's Ecosystem dividends.
Lightpaper 1.0

## Vite Ecosystem overview
Vite is a next-generation high-throughput, low-latency, and highly-scalable network. Vite uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger structure, which enables fast and feeless transactions of Vite coins and tokens created within its network. Vite's DAG structure is much more energy efficient compared to many other cryptocurrencies.

Vite's team also develops and manages ViteX, a DEX app running on Vite blockchain. It is so tightly integrated with a VITE coin that it's even a part of the official Vite Wallet app. ViteX has it's own utility token, VX. VX is used to incentivize usage of the DEX in a different ways. Holders of the VX are eligible for rewards from a trading fees collected by ViteX. More information on ViteX and VX is awailable on [official site](https://vitex.net/faq).

## Opportunity
The Px team is heavily betting on Vite and ViteX success. We think that specifically VX token is heavily undervalued. As the Vite ecosystem evolves and gets it's adoption of the built in DEX should also increase. That will drive exchange revenue up and so will VX holders rewards. Unlike VITE, VX is a fixed supply token with no inflation, so there is almost no non-catastrophic reasons for both token price and rewards to go down.

We see an opportunity in accumulating a substantial amount of VX, staking it and receiving BTC, ETH and USDT in rewards. Why it's important for amount of VX to be *substantial*? This is all about magic of a complex percent. The problem is that amount of each of BTC, ETH, USDT distributed each day is too small for instant reinvestment. Specifically the amount must be larger than minimum ViteX order value, so that BTC, ETH and USDT can be exchanged again for VX which can be reinvestment in stake. Daily reinvestment will give you a major advantage in a long run. But not only that. VX distribution is very limited in supply and time. Ever dropping VX distribution will end in September 2027. So the sooner and faster you will "mine" VX the more you will get. More to that, we can speculate VX price will only grow in time as ViteX will grow in price, resulting in VX holdings to become large asset which is just nice to have! However even if it doesn't grow in price or even become less, we will still have nice income as dividends.

So Px idea is pretty simple:
1. Gather a pool of assets (pool is required for daily reinvestment);
2. Invest pool assets;
3. Reinvest and redistribute income between pool participants.
This is an asset management system in one of it's simple forms.

## Values
### Pragmatic (anti-hype) and safe
Px has nothing to do with hype. This token will not (probably) "moon" you anywhere. Don't expect daily news. It's about getting sustainable income with a "magic" of complex percent.
Needless to say Px investments prefer a "safe-bet" type investments, with a rare exceptions.

### Community natural growth
Naturally related to previous one. We don't force or proactively incentivize anyone to purchase Px tokens. This ideally should be DYOR type decision for a like-minded people.

### Crypto knowledge sharing and learning 
We encourage holders to share knowledge and discuss investments opportunities in crypto space. While we already have a strategy in place for funds distribution we are open to new ideas and opportunities.

## Tokenomics
### Supply
The initial and total supply of Px is 100,000,000 (100M) tokens. This makes it easy calculating your share: owning 1,000,000 (1M) tokens grants you 1% of the profit distribution share.
Burning of tokens is not planned and prohibited for everyone except the team.

### Distribution
Following numbers may change before distribution starts.
- Team: 20%;
- Distribution sale: 80%.
The "Team" part covers all additional expenses should they ever come.
Also "Team" have "initial stake" of ?,000 VITE in the project.

### Reinvestment
As team is dedicated to Px value growth and project main idea, all 20% of the team share are reinvested into pool initially, and 0.5% are unlocked for the team each quarter, i.e. it will be fully unlocked after 10 years (2% a year). Unlocked dividends part are free to use for the team, but most probably they will be used for buyback operations.

### Dividends
Dividends are paid on weekly basis. For now they are currently planned to be pain in VX and VITE.

## Roadmap (Project phases)
### 1. Initiation (~Q1 2022)
No major holders except for the team.
At this stage incoming rewards are being added to the pool from team initial stake.
Testing of the rewards distribution is performed with interested participants.

### 2. Distribution (~Q2-Q4 2022)
We have a very unusual distribution model we are proud of.
The distribution will be performed via sell of the tokens on ViteX exchange.
The sell will come in batches of 1M tokens. Initial batch price will be 0.025 VITE per 1 PX, and will increase by 0,001 on each batch with batch 80 price being 0.104 VITE per 1 PX.
By the end of the phase all Px tokens should have been distributed.

### 3. Growth (2022~2027)
Now then we have full pool at our disposal, we can make strategic decisions on investments and enjoy "snowball" effect.

### 4. Buyback (2022-2027)
As mentioned before each quarter 0.5% of the dividends share will be released for the team. They are free for the team to use, but most of it will be used for market buyback operations. Larger team share size will allow further increase both reinvestment and buyback.

### 5. Project termination (2027-?)
Final distribution of the accumulated funds will happen eventually and shareholders will receive proportional part of the accumulated funds (should be mostly VX).
After that Px token will have no value.

## Summary
- Px (PX) is asset management system;
- Px is focused on safe investments in core Vite ecosystem token VX and VITE coin;
- Px have a clearly defined lifecycle of approximately 5 years;
- Px success is dependent on Vite ecosystem success.
